# reddit-page-downloader
Uses praw library and python fpdf2 library to download self-text reddit posts as pdfs

Upon running the script, it will ask for a URL. Enter the URL for the reddit post you want to download. The script will return Done if it is successful. It will download the pdf into the same folder. Only works for selfposts on reddit currently. You need to have a client ID from reddit to run this. I have min in a praw.ini file that is kept in the same folder as the script. Run from cmd or terminal.
